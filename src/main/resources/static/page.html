        <h1>The Bogey Beast</h1>
        <p>A woman finds a pot of treasure on the road while she is returning from work. Delighted (very happy) with her luck, she decides to keep it. As she is taking it home, it keeps changing. However, her enthusiasm refuses to fade away (disappear or faint slowly).

          What Is Great About It: The old lady in this story is one of the most cheerful characters anyone can encounter in English fiction. Her positive disposition (personality) tries to make every negative situation seem like a gift, and she helps us look at luck as a matter of our view rather than events.</p>
        <h1>The Tortoise and the Hare</h1>
        <p>This classic fable (story) tells the story of a very slow tortoise (another word for turtle) and a speedy hare (another word for rabbit). The tortoise challenges the hare to a race. The hare laughs at the idea that a tortoise could run faster than him, but when the two actually race, the results are surprising.</p>
        <h1>The Night Train at Deoli</h1>
        <p>Ruskin Bond used to spend his summer at his grandmother's house in Dehradun. While taking the train, he always had to pass through a small station called Deoli. No one used to get down at the station and nothing happened there. Until one day he sees a girl selling fruit and he is unable to forget her.

          What Is Great About It: Ruskin Bond is a writer who can communicate deep feelings in a simple way. This story is about our attachment to strangers and why we cherish (value or appreciate deeply) them even though we do not meet them ever again.</p>
